# PythonAndMongoDb
Practicing using Python and MongoDb together.  Mostly to learn how to use a NoSQL database.  Followed along the getting started tutorial at "https://www.mongodb.com/blog/post/getting-started-with-python-and-mongodb".  

Things I had to do to set this up.

hosted on my local machine by:
1. Installing MongoDb
2. In command prompt running the mongod.exe

I used MongoDB Compass Community to view most of the changes that were done by the tutorial.

I originally attempted to use my computer's name in the connection string, but that failed so I used "localhost" instead.
